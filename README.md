# ConsigliaViaggi

CV'19 (Consiglia Viaggi) is a complex and distributed Information System aimed at providing a modern, multichannel support platform for travel-related content.

## System Architecture

The distributed system consists of:

- **Back-Office**: Administered by administrators for managing lodging facilities and reviews.
- **Front-End**: Accessed by end-users for searching lodging facilities and viewing related reviews, including on-the-go location-based services (e.g., displaying all restaurants within a 500m radius of the user's current location).

## Key System Services

The primary services offered by the system are as follows:

1. **Lodging Facilities Display**: View lodging facilities using advanced search filters.
2. **Reviews Display**: Access reviews for identified facilities with various filters (star rating, etc.).
3. **Add a New Review**: Allow users to contribute by adding new reviews.
4. **Facility Management**: Administration functions for managing lodging facilities.
5. **Review Management**: Administration functions for managing reviews.
6. **Visitor Management**: Administration functions for managing visitors.
7. **Statistics Generation**: Generate statistics related to travel and user activities.

The CV'19 platform aims to enhance the travel experience by providing comprehensive information, user reviews, and management capabilities, making it a valuable resource for both end-users and administrators.
